			"I wrote a review already and gave this five stars (under Kate) but I think because I accidentally hit “done” on the first review before realizing \nI hadn’t yet included a picture of me wearing it, it only posted the one. Hopefully revolve will post this one as well - I don’t *think* there are any other photos for size referencing, but even if there are, the more you have, the more it helps! Just to repeat from my review below - I’m 5’5, approximately 100 lbs. , approximately 32-24-33. I’m wearing an XS in the pic which looks as though it fits rather well, and while it fit better than I’d thought (it looks a lot bigger until you try it on), it was still slightly loose in a few areas, as I’m used to wearing an XXS. I had ordered this a couple years ago, and wanted to exchange for the XXS but it was sold out at that time!",

I love the results every single time, and I got the hang of it super quickly (unlike any other hair curler I’ve used). \nHighly recommend for looser curls!! \nI received this product in exchange for an honest review.",

I had the two photos taken on different days because of how my hair was styled but i really like the curling wand style. It is very effective and holds wave all day. My hair never holds style but this wand is just the right temp to do so without burning or damaging my hair. It left my hair smelli g great with no burnt tinge to it. That also assures me that it does way less damage to my hair that just straightened style. i love how long the waves lasted all day no matter the season.",

			"Love this top! I work for the company and try many different products and I definitely had to drop a note on this one! The burgundy color is beautiful! The neckline doesn't move at all on me, so I am not annoyingly adjusting it all of the time. The cream/ivory color I did return as it was a bit more on the warmer/yellow tone side which doesn't work with my complexion. The material is soft and stretchy, but still firm/thick enough to help with shaping your waist + more, it is not see through in the slightest! The photo attached reflects the tops length on me, it is slightly cropped, and had shrunk a tiny bit in the wash but not significantly. I am wearing a XS, am 5'3\", chest 34\", waist 25-26\", and around 107lbs. I will be buying more colors soon! #revolve_employee",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I own a single-barrel waver so I was curious how a triple-barrel would look on my hair. I love the look of the messy waves, and with a small learning curve (I watched a YouTubevideo), I found the the waver easy to use. The tool overall is quite heavy, and was harder to use with my right hand on the right side of my head, even in the mirror. I will use this more often for special occasions, or when someone else could do this style for me, for those reasons. The wavy style was easy to achieve with heat spray, and the waver, and I used hairspray to set the style. The waves lasted great overnight, and just needed a quick tousle, with a little dry shampoo. I was gifted this product for my honest review.",

It sits well as is, but I definitely could have had it altered a bit to fit better. The chest area was a little long, but still functional for my body type. If you have a shorter torso you may have the same issue, but nothing sticky inserts didn\'t fix. I couldn\'t grab a full length photo, but this is the front and back for reference. #REVOLVE_employee',

			"This product looks very nice on the counter, comes nicely packaged, but overall it wasn't my favorite. I have coarser, wavy, thick hair. The problems is it's bulky; it's very hard to use on shorter layers. There is also only one temperature setting (365) , but if your hair is like mine typically you need a higher setting for the wave or curl to take, so it really didn't do much. This would be great for someone with very long, fine, and thin hair, looking for body",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Overall, I really do like this hair waver. It does a great job giving pretty beach waves life. The barrel is very easy to use and has a heat protected top so you can hold the end while bringing it through your hair. It seems pretty durable and easy to travel with if needed. My only complaint is not having a temperature listing or where you can adjust the heat temp. That’d be nice so ppl with finer hair like mine don’t fry their hair. My hair did smell a little hot after using so I won’t use this daily. Still a solid product.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This is actually my first time using a thin wand. I’m very surprised with the outcome! This wand is AMAZING! It heated up super fast and curl my hair super fast and beautiful!!! Usually it takes a very long time for me to curl my hair. This wand doesn’t damage or burn my hair. It curls fast and gentle for my hair. I only need 5 secs for small strand to curl and move on to next. With my other curler, I have to leave it on at least 15-20 seconds and have to repeat again for the curl to stay and be curly. My after pic, only took me less than 1 minute to do 1/5 of my hair!!! Overall, I LOVE IT!",

			"It’s great for what it’s intended for - a little black top to go with just about everything. But I’ve noticed people complaining about the quality… and if you’ve shopped on revolve regularly for any length of time, you would likely know that $49 is about as cheap as you’re going to get for a top like this - hence, the quality will not be similar to something from ALC, Zimmermann, retrofete, to name a few. In my opinion, it runs pretty TTS, if not slightly big. But then again, if you see my pics (one is from a mirror that needed to be windexed, lmao, the other a screenshot from a video clip) - but the point is to show how tiny my body frame is. I ordered the XXS, am 5’5 and 100 lbs. , approx. 31/32A-23. 5-33”. But those blessed with more on top may want to contemplate sizing down.",

I loveeeee the look this gives my hair, it gives a natural waving effect that's perfect for literally any season. my hair does not hold a curl very well but the temperature of this makes them hold all day, even in the Vegas heat. The actual wand is soooo nice and sleek, I can see myself using this for many many years to come, it's made to last. absolutely worth every penny.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I have owned and loved ghd straighteners for the past 20 years so I was excited to have the chance to try their new Chronos Curve Max Wand. First impressions - the packaging is beautiful, very chic and the design of the actual curling iron is incredibly sleek. This curling wand, just like my straightener appears premium. Once turned on the wand plays a little tune and lights begin to flash, once it heats up these lights remain on- this literally only takes seconds. The wand is really easy to use. I love that theres no clip on the iron to hold the hair as I always find these tricky. The wand curled my hair quite quickly, I didn't need to leave the iron on my hair for long - which I like because this reduces the damage that the heat could cause - my hair hasn't felt dry at all. I love the look of the loose curls with this size barrel which settled really nicely into a neat wave. I’m sure the curls will improve as I get better at using the device. I was impressed with how shiny and sleek the texture of my hair was after styling as well- but I didn’t notice this until I looked at my own before and after pictures. The power cord is a good length - quite long and it gives you some room to move. One last thing to mention is the safety features - the cool tip and the auto-shut off which are always appreciated. I absolutely love this wand and it’s such a great edition to my hair tool mix. I would have bought it for myself if I’d known sooner how easy it is to use!",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] It has a sleek, elegant design that is light weight and feels very comfortable in the hand when styling the hair. When turning it on it has a little tune that is played and the light around the on/off switch lights up along with a light around the bottom of the curling iron; these lights blink until the curling iron is hot and then it stays solid. Upon styling the design of the barrel creates the most beautiful and perfect curls and depending on the amount of hair in each section you can easily achieve loose beachy waves or a classy defined curl. I highly recommend this curling iron.",

			"Nice curling wand.\nHeats up very quick. Takes only about 20 seconds and it’s ready to go. Definitely a learning curve to using the product. Curls quickly and nicely once you get it down. Came with a glove but it isn’t heat resistant, still burns through the glove. Can do different types of curls which is nice. The performance of the curls lasts even in humid weather, even after using it for about a month the product seems very durable and like it will last for many years.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This curling wand is great! It has a simple and sleek design. The single-button makes it very easy to use. It heats up in just 10–15 seconds and delivers instant results after only a couple of seconds on the hair. I also really appreciate the heat-protective glove that comes with it, which makes it safer. It created the perfect bouncy curls that last all day without following touch-ups. I would definitely recommend this wand for quick curls that look perfect and last all day long!",

Perfect length on me but I’m usually a Medium. I purchased and large and X-Large based on the reviews and the large wouldn’t zip up. X-Large fit perfectly.",

It heats up insanely fast, makes beautiful, long lasting, natural looking curls, and is so easy to use. It is so sleek and well made. It gets hot in less than a minute and I love how the flashing light shows you when it’s ready to use. I’ve never had such a nice hair tool and I absolutely love it. I’ve been using it for a couple weeks now and it has a permanent spot in my hair routine. It’s so quick and easy to use. Makes the cutest curled ponytail that I’ve been wearing daily. 10/10 would recommend.",

I really love that it heats up SO FAST and has the CUTEST little beeps to let you know when it’s turned on, heated-up, and turned off. Sounds just like my washing machine, haha. It has a convenient built-in stand, and one temp setting to take out the guesswork. It curled my hair really quickly too; still waiting to see how long the curl lasts. I’d recommend this wand because it’s super quick, easy to use, and gives me great spirals.",

			"This dress is beautiful!!! I got it for a wedding in Mexico & got several compliments. For me, I thought it ran a bit small. I am 5’8”, ~200lbs, 38DDD & the XL juuust fit. Length was not an issue as the dress it quite long, but it was tight in the chest. Obviously I am larger busted, but I thought it wouldn’t be an issue by ordering the XL. I think I’d have to lose like 20lbs for it to fit comfortably because I was spilling out of the top. There’s a V metal piece in the cleavage area that kept poking out of the bottom so I had to frequently slide it back in to try to keep my boobs upright & not protrude forward from the metal piece pointing straight out. The spaghetti straps were digging into my shoulders a bit as my chest is heavy, & they weren’t keeping me super secure. Overall I loved it, but I just wanted to give a fair warning to anyone else considering this dress with a largest bust as well.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I have been so pleasantly surprised by this curling iron! As someone who usually does heartless curls, using the tool itself was a bit of a learning curve, but definitely achievable. The curling iron heats up very quickly (which was nice) and I found it easy to use. The clamp was also a little tricky to use at first, but I think it really helps hold the curl in place. I have fine hair that sometimes gets weighed down and looks flat, but the curls I was able to make added more volume to my hair (as you can see in the before and after photos). I also felt that it didn’t damage my hair. I like that you can make tighter curls and beachy waves with this tool. I appreciate when a product is versatile. I’m also impressed with the design. It looks very sleek and I can tell it’s from a high quality brand. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new curling iron. It is a great product and I’m looking forward to using it more!",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I received the ghd Chronos Curve Grand curling iron in exchange for my honest opinion. I really liked this curling iron! It heats up super quickly to a temperature that ghd has found is ideal for curling hair without causing unnecessary damage. The cord was a good length to allow unrestricted movement. I found that the iron left my hair shiny, and the curls held swell throughout the day. The clamp was easy to use without getting stuck. The tool itself is very sleek looking which is nice. There is a sleep mode where it turns off without use, which I find helpful for safety reasons. It also comes with a glove to prevent burns to the hand. I do wish the barrel was a little longer as someone with long, thick hair, but it was still usable. I liked the large curls that the iron produced. There is also a 2-year warranty which is a great validation of the product’s quality and durability. I would definitely repurchase!",

			"Gorgeous dress. Sooo classy and sexy. Makes curves look fantastic. I have a little bit of a tummy and you can see it but not as much as I was expecting from a tight dress. I’ll be going bra less but adding some boob tape for an upcoming wedding. \n\nGet this dress!\n\nI’m 5’6 150lbs and a size M was perfect.",

			"Beautiful and flattering. Runs true to size. It says in the description that the model is wearing a size small. I don’t think she is. I’m usually an xs but ordered the small based on the description. I had to send it back because it was too big and baggy around my waist. Order your normal size. The matching skirt was the same way. The material feels amazing and I highly recommend both pieces. I’m 5’7”, 110 pounds and the xs was perfect.",

It’s especially great for those who want natural, bouncy curls that hold throughout the day. While it is a bit of an investment, the quality and performance absolutely justify the price. Compared to cheaper alternatives, the ghd curling wand gives smoother curls with less heat damage and significantly better hold.",

I don’t like that you can’t control the temperature, there’s just an on and off button. It does give nice beach waves and it comes with a glove to protect your hand, however I think it would be easier to use if it had the clip like old school curling irons. Overall it’s a decent curling wand just need to get used to using it.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I am so in love with this product. I didn't think it would work so well. The ghd chronos curve classic iron is a must have. It's a shorter barrel than the ones I normally use. I thought it was going to be a problem for my long hair but it wasn't. It works really well, and it evenly heats up all throughout. It also has a white light that turns on when plugged in. It's a nice touch to the curler. The curler is lightweight so you won't get tired when using it. It comes with a heat resistant glove to avoid getting burned when curling your hair. I like the long cord length, so it's not going to be a problem when using it and it doesn't tangle up when rotating the curler on hair. My curls lasted all day long, went to sleep and they still looked good the next day. It also doesn't damage the hair as it doesn't get too hot. My hair looks shiny and smooth when I use this curler. I love the fact that it doesn't make my hair have a burnt smell afterwards like other curlers do. I have definitely recommended this to my friends and family.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I love how sleek and smooth this curling iron is. I have only ever really used metal curling irons and the biggest thing I noticed with this one is that it doesn’t pull on the hair. One thing that I didn’t know was that you can’t adjust the temperature. I kind of like that because it limits the amount of buttons on the iron. I like how lightweight it is and how it makes a noise when it turns on and off. I also noticed it doesn’t burn my hair as bad as other curling irons. I am aware it comes with a heat protector glove which is a nice touch but I feel like I don’t really need it, I would’ve rather gotten a travel or protective pouch for it. Overall you can tell this is a nice quality curling iron. I am obsessed with it and will be using it going forward and ditching my metal curling iron.",

			"I'm so excited to finally upgrade my curling iron. I decided on the hd Chronos Curve Classic Curling Iron (1\" barrel). Hoping to give my wavy hair a more styled and refind look. . \nGHD says its curl-responsive technology keeps the barrel at a steady 365°F, creating smooth, defined curls in just 3-5 seconds per section. And after using it for a few weeks I completely agree! \n\nI decided to glam up for our date night and my dry wavy hair transformed into glossy, bouncy waves that looked salon-fresh. I felt stylish and romantic for our night together. My husband even took notice as well! \n\nThe curling iron is so easy to use idue to it's sleek design, ca cool tip and styling glove for extra safety, made it easy to use without burning my finger a huge deal with lifesaver for a rushed mom. It heated up in seconds, and the 8. 8 ft cord gave me room to maneuver while getting ready\n\nThis curling iron is definitely worth the investment and you'll fall in love with you rhair again after using!!\n \n\n\n\nI received this product in exchange for my honest review.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This product creates beachy waves in long hair. I used it on my daughter’s hair, as hers is longer than mine, and we were able to create some waves with it. You can see the “before” and “after” photos show a small difference in the waves, but honestly not much. \n\nThe tool was cumbersome to work with, and a little scary as it felt like it might slip out of my hands and burn one of us. The barrel doesn’t have a clamp, so you use a gloved hand to wind the hair around the barrel, then hold it in place yourself. If the barrel had a clamp (like a curling iron), I think this would work much better. Also, I found I could only wrap a small section of hair at a time. It was a lot of work for the results I achieved. \n\nI did feel the hair wasn’t “burning” the hair as much as a curling iron or flat iron often does, but it also didn’t seem to hold a curl or wave as well as other products. Overall, this wand is basically a hot rod for wrapping hair around. There are better ways to achieve better results, in my experience. However, I do appreciate the lack of damage to the hair and the soft effect of the waves.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I've been using the ghd Chronos Curve Classic 1\" curling iron for a few weeks now, and it honestly feels like bringing a salon tool into my own bathroom. The design is sleek and modern-matte black with chrome accents-and it feels lightweight\nyet sturdy in my hand. The swivel cord is salon-length, which makes it super easy to move around without tangling, and the built-in safety stand is really handy when I set it down mid-styling.\n\nPerformance is where this iron really shines. It heats up in about 25 seconds and holds a consistent 365°F, so every curl comes out smooth and shiny without me worrying about overheating my hair. The 1\" barrel is just right for creating either classic curls or softer waves, and the curls actually last. Normally my hair drops after a few hours, but with this iron, they hold all day—and if I add hairspray, I can still see bounce the next morning.\n\nWhat I love most is how polished my curls look-there's definitely extra shine and smoothness compared to my older curling iron. Plus, it comes with thoughtful features like a cool-touch tip, protective glove, auto shut-off, and a long cord for easier styling.\n\nThe only thing to note is the price-it retails for around $259, which is definitely an investment. But for me, the combination of speed, long-lasting curls, and how healthy my hair feels makes it worth every penny.\n\nIf you're looking for a premium curling iron that's reliable, fast, and delivers salon-quality results at home, l'd 100% recommend the ghd Chronos Curve Classic.",

Typically wear an xs/s or size 2 in dresses at Aritzia and size 25/26 Levi’s jeans for reference. Form fitting but not tight, stays up even though it is strapless which was perfect for a long day of wedding events because it has a wire in the neckline and a slight corset top. Got so many compliments and link requests. I am more spoon shaped, small shoulders and larger hips, small B cup chest.",

			"(I received this product in exchange for my honest review)\n I love how sleek and smooth this curling iron is. It definitely feels high end. It heats up instantly, I was so surprised! \nI have pretty long hair that is pretty stubborn holding curls. \nI was able to get nice soft waves with this curling iron. No super tight curls but that's just kind of how my hair is. \nI love how it has a 20 minute shut off if inactive. The only downside for me is there is only one heat setting. I know it's safer for your hair but sometimes I need to crank up that temp to get a good curl! Overall though, this was a pretty nice curling iron, my hair looks shinier after using it. It is pretty pricey, it would have to be a splurge for me :)",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The GHD curler is very user-friendly and delivers smooth, even curls with ease. It distributes heat evenly, ensuring consistent results across my hair. The only downside is that it feels slightly heavy, and because I have thick hair, the styling process takes a bit longer. For thicker strands, holding the curler for about 8 seconds before gently gliding it down the length works best. On the plus side, the design is sleek, stylish, and aesthetically pleasing. Overall, aside from the weight, I’ve had a great experience with this tool and would definitely recommend it.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This hair curler is seriously amazing. Firstly, the packaging is sophisticated and professional looking. The curler is neatly packed. The box contains the curler itself, instructions, and a heat protectant glove. Actual curling was insanely easy and smooth. Once you turn it on, it heats up in SECONDS. The temperature is not adjustable which could potentially be an issue for some, but did not bother me. The cord has a swivel so it doesn’t get tangled when in use. Cord length is also decently long. It did not take long at all to curl my hair. It left my hair sleek and shiny, which I’ve never experienced with a curling iron (or any hot hair tool). Seriously the best I’ve ever used!",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This hair curler gets three stars for its equal amounts of pros and cons. Pros: it is a pretty and simple design, it is lightweight, it heats up quickly, it doesn’t tug uncomfortably on the hair as you’re curling, and once you get some practice on it, it is pretty simple to use. This products nice loose curls, similar to that that I get on my flat iron. It takes a couple tries to get used to this style of curler but once you find the rhythm it’s easy to use. However, there are a few cons to this I’ve found. Cons: no heat adjustment ( I know it’s meant to have the “perfect temperature” for curling hair but I like to have variability because not everyone’s hair is the same), the curls do not last (even with leave in treatments and hair spray), you have to be very careful on fine hair not to leave creases from the clamp, and the price is very high. I think there are hair curlers that do just as good of a job for a much cheaper price. I also expected like a travel case or something extra because it is so expensive, but you get get the machine and a heat protecting glove. Overall, I love the sleekness and how easy it is to do my hair with this but the lack of versatility, how short the curls last on my hair, and the price make this curler just ok.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I love this thing!!!! If you are like me and don’t know the first thing about doing your hair- this one is for you. Firstly, the warm up time is SO short, I believe just under a minute, so you don’t have to preheat ahead of time like other curlers. It plays a little noise when it’s done heating up so you don’t need to guess when it’s time to use it, and the best part- there is no heat settings! One of my least fav parts of trying to curl my hair at home in the past has been trying to figure out what temperature to use but this product takes the need for that away completely so there is only one setting for super easy use. For the actual curling process, it took me literally under 5 minutes to do my whole head. I was going for a “messy but still cute” vibe just to put up in a ponytail, but if you want the curls more uniform and cleaner than mine, you can still expect to get your full head done in under 10 minutes. This is just great. The curler itself is sort of heavy BUT because it took me so little time to get it all done, I didn’t find that my hand/arm got tired or anything. Because it’s not super light I probably wouldn’t want to travel with this but this is still a fantastic option for a super quick minimal effort hair style. A BIG styling tip that I thought up about half way through my hair, is that when you move the wand down to curl the middle and bottom parts of your hair, scrunch/push up the hair above the wand a bit so it starts to cool while in that curl position, otherwise the curls will loosen up fairly quickly if they immediately fall down while still hot (which is why one side of my head in the photo is a lot more loose than the other, LOL). Overall I think this product is great and I love how it instantly made my hair look cute with such minimal effort. If you are not good at doing your hair or just don’t have tons of time to style your hair, this is absolutely perfect.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Comes in a very nice black sleek box. It’s very straight forward to use. It comes with heated gloves during use. I tested out the glove and it works for berief moment. It’s a sturdy curling iron. It’s not too heavy where my arms were getting tired. The pull of the hair to the ends is not a smooth as others I’ve used but it does the job of not slipping out when curling. I like that it heats very quickly and (maybe because my hair is short) it doesn’t need to be held in place for very long. Overall…I would recommend it. It’s easy to use even for beginner in using a curling iron.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I far prefer wands to curling irons, both for ease of use and natural results. I really liked this wand (1. 5 inch size) because it created very loose curls that look like you woke up with perfect hair! It’s very easy to use, it warned up in a minute or two and only took me like 5-10 to do my hair (depends on your length/texture/ability), but I do wish there was a heat level that you could change. It looks very high quality and I’m excited to continue using it!",

I was surprised to know it does NOT have any heat adjustment settings, it just get hot to the right temperature. Just click it on and it does the work. It came with a set of heat protection gloves which I really love. Literally my hair is flat and long and 5 sec count in and the curling wand was curling my hair, giving me beautiful curls! This is definitely a record. I love that as I was curling my hair, the cord would come along as well. It’s a rotating cord, and I appreciate that feature.",

Big, Bouncy Curls with Minimal Effort. sleek, high-performance tool built for creating soft, voluminous curls that look like you just left the salon. Barrel hits the sweet spot for body and bounce. Able to use for night out or for a casual day out. The iron is lightweight and easy to maneuver thanks to its ergonomic handle and swivel cord. Safety touches like the built-in stand and auto shut-off after 20 minutes add peace of mind.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Move over, mermaids — this ghd Chronos Curve Conical wand just claimed the crown. I plugged it in, blinked, and it was ready to turn my bedhead into high-definition, Pinterest-worthy beach curls. The tapered 1 inch to 0. 9 inch barrel makes me feel like a professional stylist (minus the salon prices), and the curls? They actually last all day — through coffee runs, errands, and even that unexpected rain shower.\n\nFast curling? Absolutely. I’ve spent more time waiting for my toast to pop than it took to do my whole head. If you want the kind of waves that make people ask, “Who’s your hair girl?”, this is the magic wand. Literally.",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The box that the Chronos Curve Max Wand came in felt extremely high quality and luxurious. Once opened, I fell in love with how sleek this curling wand looked. It’s extremely simple to use as the only thing button is the on/off switch. When you turn it on, it beeps and a light fades in and out. Once it’s ready, the light stays on. It took me about 20 minutes to curl my hair, which was pretty quick. I also love the width of the barrel as it’s bigger and gives me more relaxed curls. The only reason why I gave it a 4/5 is that the curls seem to loosen quicker than my other curler. I had a great experience with everything else about the curling wand!",

			"I have never owned a hot tool quite like this so I was a bit nervous but still excited. My daughter’s hairstylist always has the cutest hair styles and she suggested a wave Barrel. GHD did the job I was wanting! It has a very well design barrel with a stand built into the bottom of the tool, keeping it safe on my countertop. Very quick to warm up and create the fun waves. I’ll keep practicing until I’m a bit better. Until then, this is fun and I can’t wait to become a pro!!",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I just tried the ghd Triple Barrel Waver and overall, I'm pretty happy with it. It heats up super fast, which is a huge plus when I'm short on time. The waves it creates are gorgeous – very beachy and natural-looking, and they last all day without needing a ton of hairspray. It's a bit bulky, so it's not the easiest to store. I think it's a great tool for achieving effortless waves. It's definitely worth the investment if you're looking for a quick and easy way to style your hair.",

			"I was hoping this mouth tape would help prevent me from snoring. I have mild sleep apnea and a CPAP machine that I have a love/ hate relationship with. I was hoping the mouth tape would save the day and I wouldn't have to wear the CPAP any longer. It seems to slightly improve the snoring, but not fully ( according to my husband). I will actually try using them together to see if there is any benefit to that. This mouth tape is very comfortable and I do feel like I get a deeper sleep when I wear it. It does not irritate my skin when wearing, or removing. If I get up and need to take a drink of water, it will easily re-adhere to my skin. The packaging is cute and I don't mind having it on my bedside table. The shape of the tape itself is also not hideous when wearing, so I don't feel like a total troll lol. So far I would say it's a win!",

			"This one is perfect. He's up so quickly and I love the tones unless you know when it's ready or it's turned on and it lights up in a blank. So it is great for you to hear your signal. And it's ready to the versatility of it. You can definitely do a little pieces or big pieces and get different kind of curls, and the packaging is very high and it comes up the heat protective glove and. It has very classy finishes. It looks like it's a lot of quality. And my hair instantly became less frizzy after using it. It definitely was the perfect size to make the girls. I needed it was quick and I didn't have any problems with that being too hot or too cold.",

			"Love this tool! Definitely a learning curve with it because it's so large but I think I got the hang now. I have straight hair that doesn't hold a curl and this wave lasts all day in my hair. I did burn my shoulder the first time I used it so be careful. I would definitely recommend this waver to anyone who doesn't want the work of curling their hair but wants the look. I love this waver so much and I'm not surprised because ghd makes the best hair tools!",

			"[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I love this hair waver! This GHD wave triple barrel waver gives you volume instantly, it doesn’t cause frizzy waves, and it is very effective at giving you the full, waved, beach hair look in minutes. Also, the waver just looks sleek and professional.\nPros- Lots of pros! It has a coated end to protect you from burning your fingers while holding it. It heats up quickly and it lets you know with a beep when it is heated fully. It doesn’t take long to do my whole head. It took about 15 minutes for the whole head and I have rather long hair. I like that it has large barrels and it gives you loose waves rather than looking like the 80s electrocuted look. The waver is easy to operate and easy to hold. Fits nicely in my hand and I don’t feel like I would easily drop it. I can easily hold it at different angles without any issues, and it works either way (barrel side up or upside down. )I like that it has the cord that does a 360 turn so I’m not getting my cord all tangled up. Feels like an actual professional waver not cheaply made at all and like it wouldn’t easily break. The ceramic coating on each barrel is definitely a major pro for me. I have damaged ends and this doesn’t feel like it adds damage and I don’t get that fried feeling. I always make sure I put heat protectant on, but the ceramic coating puts my mind at ease that I’m not causing more damage to my hair. It’s versatile you can do looser waves or you can section smaller pieces to get a tighter more defined wave. There is no need for hairspray unless your hair is extremely straight and doesn’t hold styles at all. Curls typically fall after a few hours in my hair and even WITHOUT hairspray my hair is still wavy after 8 hours.\nCon- The price. It’s pricier than most wavers I will say that, but the quality is definitely there and it seems worth it to me to pay a little extra to not fry your hair, keep it styled all day, and to have a product that will hold up and not break on you in a couple weeks. Treat yourself once in a while! \n\nI have mermaid hair and I love it and I highly recommend this waver!",

So if you don’t want too much attention, this may not be the gown for you. In my case, the couple was very fashion forward and the bride loved my look so it worked out well for me. My only issue is that the straps were a bit too big. So I had to get them tailored to fit me. Otherwise, it was a total knockout gown.",

			"I received this product free for my honest review. I have frizzy hair so when it comes to styling it I do get lazy sometimes. This curling iron gives more control and easy to use but can leave clamp marks if you’re not careful. You should also use a heat protector. The curler makes more natural-looking waves but requires a bit of practice. It is beginner-friendly but can tangle your hair if sections are too big and the curls will look chunky. It’s very sleek looking and extremely light weight which makes it so much easier to use. There is no heat level setting just an on and off button. Out with the old and in with the new! I love this product.",

It's super moisturizing and gives such a nice touch of color and shine without feeling sticky or heavy. Also, the packaging itself is sooo satisfying.\n\nThe berry Happy Hour shade is chef's kiss. Been loving using it alone during the day for a clean, easy look, and then with a little lip liner at night to dress it up. Will definitely need a refill once I run out!",

			"Bought this for my wedding in Las Vegas in August. It’s exactly like it’s pictured, but the craftsmanship is iffy considering the price. I am 5’5” and 145lbs with a smaller upper body and I ordered a medium and it fits a little snug but still comfortable. If you have bigger hips and a butt it will be short in the back, but I’m okay with it. There are loose threads randomly. There is a small rip in the bodice and the boning is sticking out. The clasp in the back is sewn poorly and will probably come off on my next try on if I don’t reinforce it. I’m nervous if I lace the back too tight it will rip the eyelets. All in all it is a gorgeous, fun dress that I will still be wearing but for the price I shouldn’t have to be sewing it right out of the mailer.",

			"I just wore this dress to a gala and had a record number of random strangers come up to tell me they love my dress (eight--my husband started to keep track). It has got enough stretch to be comfortable but it is very flattering, especially in the waist. The lining feels high quality and there was no sequin fallout. I am 5'6\" 140 and the medium was perfect--with heels I didn't need to have it hemmed at all. I did alter the neck slightly to make it tighter--it has a bra style clasp with three settings and the tightest one was still loose. Loved wearing it, will definitely wear it again!",

			"I love this dress, good quality, looks expensive, and makes you looked dressed up for beachy/pool events. I usually wear a M, I got an L because they didn’t have M and I was desperate and it fit perfectly, it gave me room to hide any love handles or bloating, but enough room for me to pull the string and tighten it, I think M would have been tight on the hips but probably more form fitting. I’m 5’7 and weight about 150-155.\nI did t take one single photo this day b it I posted a screenshot of a video.",

			"I’m just not sure where one could wear this. The top gives room for those with larger busts, which is a plus (36DD here). It is low cut though, making it a bit too sexy for a wedding, but it is a bit too fancy for date night… The seam in the mid thigh seems to pucker out a bit. The flap of fabric on the right hip that comes out sits a bit oddly. The ruching makes it pretty forgivable in the abdominal area. The color is gorgeous. If it was $30-40, I would keep it and wait for an opportunity to wear it, but it is too expensive for the quality/fit. I am usually a 10 and M or L and probably would go up to a L. I got a medium, which did fit, but snugly.",

It’s on the thinner side in consistency but seems to hold up in hydration. It’s definitely not DEEPLY hydrating but it does enough for my dryness needs. It’s by no means spectacular but it’s a solid conditioner if you’re looking to try something new!",

			"Wow!!! I have never loved jeans or the way I look in them. I am 5’8” and ~145 but mostly bottom heavy…thicker thighs and bigger butt. I’ve always struggled to find jeans that fit well and I’m so glad I pulled the trigger and bought these. I got a size 27 and they’re loose in the waist but fit my butt and thighs perfectly. I love how the legs fit and I think it really elongates my legs and slims them out. They’re still long on me but I like the look so I won’t get them hemmed. I’m wearing them right now with a fun belt and I’m truly obsessed. They are so comfortable which is something I’ve never said before about jeans. I could not recommend these enough!!!! Worth the price!",

When I laid the dress down to iron it I figured out that only one side has this pleated/darted detail and that’s the reason why the neckline was a little crooked when I put it on. Trying to iron some pleats into the other side but it would’ve been nice to know beforehand. Still super cute on besides that",

			"I've never received more compliments on a dress - I felt amazing in this! It says crimson but I thought it was a really bright hot pink. I loved it! It does come a little long, heads up if you are 5'8 or shorter. Really easy to dance in, I didn't think the slit was too high up.\n\nI ordered a small and it fit like a glove (minus it being a little long):\n5'6, 135lbs, 34D, athletic build, usually a size 4.",

I am 5’3” about 135lbs and got size XS. It definitely runs big. \nThe material is sweater like. \nI loved the back. \nChest area has no support. \nAnd it’s definitely too long for the short girlies.",

			"gifted by BeautyBio. This facial tool has been the most exciting thing to come into my beauty routine ever! I have been intrigued by HydraFacials that were only available in spas or salons for the past few years but couldn’t bring myself to pay the hefty price for just one treatment. The glofacial tool offers an at home version and multiple treatments for the average price of one HydraFacial near me. After reading the directions that came in the package and watching some how to videos provided by BeautyBio I used it for the first time. Each treatment is 2 to 3 minutes per area of your face, not 2 to 3 minutes for your whole face like I initially though, which makes way more sense since 3 different attachments with different sizes are provided for the different areas of your face. I was really impressed with the 3 levels of suction that removed the noticeable blackheads on my chin and around my nose. Definitely recommend it as a worthy investment for your skin.",

			"The blazer itself gets 5 stars. The delivery and packaging from Revolve…zero stars. DO NOT buy this blazer from Revolve. They have no consideration for packaging and care for a beautiful piece. I received the blazer extremely wrinkled and disorganized, thrown into a plastic bag (no hanger) and it just looked awful out of the bag. I told customer service we pay too much money for a luxury piece to be received this way. They were great and sent me another as an exchange but it came in the exact same way. I am returning and not bothering with this even on a sale. Hopefully I’ll find it on a sale at another retailer. I’m so disappointed. I love Revolve but this was really disappointing and sad.",

It’s easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the clarifying concentrate gives an instant refreshed look. It’s definitely a splurge, but totally worth it for an at-home facial feel.

I felt like the length was perfect. This dress screams “I’m here to party!” I have an athletic build: 34B, 137pounds and 5’7.",

Good price point for what you get. \n\nI didn’t love the straps it came with so I took the metal buckle off the small end of the long strap to make it into a wristlet. Easy with a pair of pliers.

			"This tool exceeded my initial expectations and is pretty good! It definitely sucks out a surprising amount of gunk from my pores, which is gross but satisfying. \nMy skin feels noticeably cleaner and a bit plumper after, like I've had a mini-facial. The blue light is a nice touch for breakouts too.\nBeyond the immediate clean feeling, I've noticed a subtle improvement in my skin's overall texture and hydration. I have very dry skin. \nIt just looks a bit more radiant and feels softer. \nI was skeptical, but it's genuinely become a satisfying step in my weekly routine (sometimes twice a week) leaving my skin feeling refreshed and prepped for the rest of my skincare.\nGifted by beautybio",

I love the slight shimmer and how it looks under makeup. It gives just the right amount of glow for a healthy looking complexion. I no longer looked washed out, but instead I look like I’ve spent a little time in the sun. Loved these and will repurchase!",

I absolutely love this facial tool - it’s extremely easy to use (the booklet included is also straight to the point), is gentle on the skin so I use to 2-3x a week depending on my needs, charges fast and the leaves my skin feeling soft and deeply cleaned. The tip attachments are easy to switch out and clean. At first, I used left than half from the clean chamber, next time I’ll go slower to see if that changes anything…otherwise I’ll add less concentrate and less water. Gifted by beautybio",

I am 5ft 3, 122lbs, 34DD, normally wear Small, but got XSmall, this brand runs large. \n\nThe dress is really sea through and I need to figure out a way to wear it (it’s backless, I’m assuming I’d need to wear some sort of pasties). Easy to put on - not sure what the other reviewer was saying about “figuring out” how to put on. \n\nThe dress fits like a glove. Just beautiful. Just keep in mind it’s very see through.

I’m 5’4 and the dress went down to my ankles, so it was more of a maxi dress. Unfortunately from the waist down the dress was very see through, so I recommend purchasing a slip to wear underneath.",

			"I’m so impressed with Golden Glow Hydration Facial by BeautyBio. It’s really easy to use and it’s very gentle and effective. I have a lot of clogged pores especially in my T-zone area. GLOfacial gently and easily removed my the most stubborn blackheads leaving my pores looking clear and smaller. It’s amazing seeing dirt and oil being removed from my pores. My complexion instantly looked so much better! I’m totally hooked, this device is truly the best thing I’ve ever used on my face. Gifted by BeautyBio.",

It is pretty long, I got a medium and I’m 5 foot 10 and was wearing 3 inch heels and it was hitting the floor. I typically wear a medium, occasionally a small, and a medium fit great. I probably could have also worn a small Since it’s quite stretchy. My measurements are about 36 chest, 28 waist, 37 hips. I never write read reviews, but I looked at dresses for months for this wedding and I couldn’t be happier with it. If you’re looking for a dress that will flatter curves this is definitely a fantastic choice.",

But the vest is too baggy for the skirt, it sort of has an A-line shape and flares out around your hips. I tried to capture it but I don’t think you can tell much, probably in the picture where I’m in front of the door the most. Also, the skirt is teeny tiny and the bottom of my butt showed (I’m 5’7” 130). Sad :(",

It is extremely cheaply made, with many sewing defects all over the dress. If I decide to keep it, I will have to take it to the tailor and have many parts of it re-sewn. This does not justify the very high price of this dress.",

			"Loved this dress for my birthday! It runs slightly large, so if you're going for a more bodycon fit, I’d recommend sizing down. Great quality, and the ruched mesh give you the flexibility to adjust the length to wear it above or below the knee. Very sexy and versatile. I received so many compliments all night",

The embellishments are stunning. \nFor reference, I am 5’9 / 125lbs and usually wear an AUS size 8. It wasn’t tight at all - could have probably gone down a size to have it more fitted (there’s some stretch) but I’d be worried about the length.",

But the revolve team was kind enough to send me a replacements with overnight's shipping. \nWhen I finally tried the top on, the zipper was very difficult to pull up and down. There is a major flaw in the way that the zipper is designed and the stitching around it. Was gonna wear it for the Father’s Day surprise dinner I was throwing but I opted for my old aritzia instead . Much higher quality than this overpriced hot garbage.",

			"This dress is beautiful. The color and material are high quality and the style is unique and really, really pretty and elegant. I don’t have the best photos in it but hopefully you can see how pretty the style is. The color is beautiful, it drapes perfectly and the one shoulder/off the shoulder + slit is very feminine and flattering. Did I mention the color?!? I got SO many compliments and genuinely can’t imagine why these reviews aren’t higher!",

			"I LOVE this dress. It's even better in person, with bright colors and very high quality - no misplaced or missewn sequins, although the sequins are a little scratchy around the armpit. \n\nEven though I'm 5'3, I can get away with wearing it with 4 inch heels and it doesn't need to be hemmed. \n\nIn these pics I am wearing a size small, but I exchanged for an XS so it would really snatch me in at the waist. I am typically an XS and this one just barely works - I couldn't gain a pound! The butt is the limiting factor. I am 5'3, 114 lb, 32-26-35.\n\nSo I wouldn't say that it runs small, but just that there isn't much stretch to the inner lining.",

			"I recently wore this dress to a wedding, and I truly felt like a vision. The design is absolutely stunning. The fabric flows beautifully and catches the light just right, giving it a unique quality. The fit was incredibly flattering, hugging in all the right places while still allowing me to move and dance comfortably all night.\n\nWhat I loved most were the details: the delicate stitching, the shimmer, and the way it made me feel the moment I put it on—confident, beautiful, and completely wedding-ready. I received so many compliments throughout the evening! If you’re looking for a dress that combines beauty, comfort, and a touch of magic, this one is truly unforgettable.",

I wore it to a summer wedding and got lots of compliments on the colors. It may be too revealing if you have a larger chest though. \nI love that its adjustable strings in back as well. Wish I had more things to wear it to!",

			"This is a beautiful dress with great colors, but it didn’t flatter my body shape as expected. I’m 5’1”, 155 lbs, and have an hourglass figure. I ordered a Medium.\n\nWhat worked:\n • The length was just right — not too short, not too long.\n • The waist fit perfectly, and the adjustable tie helped define my shape.\n\nWhat didn’t:\n • The shoulders were droopy, making the top look oversized in a way that felt unintentional.\n • The hips were too tight, which stopped the skirt from draping nicely like it does on the model.\n • The fabric is thinner than expected, which makes it look a bit less polished in person.\n\nOverall, this dress seems better suited for a taller, slimmer or more rectangular body type. If you have curves, you may find the fit awkward in key areas.",

			"Loved this dress! Wore it for brunch and got so many compliments. Material is light and comfortable. Was considering giving this a 3 star due to the chest area falling down. Not sure if it was a size problem, the material near the chest would also fold and show the inside of the dress, I had to constantly pull up. I think some sticky tape would have helped. Other than that loved it!",

			"I love this dress. I’m 5’2” about 120 lbs and got a medium. The bottom half fit very well and the ruching is extremely flattering. The top part felt a little roomy for my 34C so I wore a sticky bra and it helped. Only issue is the top elastic wants to flip down a little bit I used boop tape to secure it to my body and you couldn’t see it through the shine because of the built in liner. A smaller size might have fixed it but I was scared it would then be too short for my preference. Didn’t detract from how hot I felt or how many compliments I got all night. This is by far the hottest dress I own.",

			"I LOVE this dress! It’s so fun! The issue is the boning in the built in bra and the thinness of the material used for the dress. If you have boobs, the boning will show through and there’s nothing you can do about it. The dress is so thin that you can see nips if you were to remove the bra. A medium fit but I went up to the large hoping it would be loose enough in the bust; it wasn’t and then it created puckering with the zipper. Sadly had to return.",

So you can imagine my surprise and disappointment when I opened the package to see that the dress was a totally different shade of pink! It was more like a raspberry or magenta shade.\nI have given 4 stars because the dress fit perfectly and the color that I got actually looked pretty good on me. \nIt lost a star because of false advertising!\nIt is a beautiful dress, nevertheless. I got loads of compliments at the wedding!\nI am 5' 6 1/2\", weigh 130 lbs and ordered a size M.",

I wanted them tighter in waist & butt since legs are baggy wide -looks cute with matching beige top. I’m sure like any jean they will loosen a bit with wear.",

The material is cotton which I was hesitant about but it was literal pefecttion! Highly recomend!!!',

But the metal applicator the angle in the size of it is so much superior to everything else. I've ever tried and and the formula a little bit because it just works so well. And I instantly start seeing the puffiness in my eyes go away. And the fine lines dissipate, this definitely is a superior product. To most eye creams that I have tried",

			"The BeautyBio Eyelighter Concentrate is incredibly easy to use. Just press the metal tip, and the cream dispenses smoothly. The applicator feels cool on the skin, which makes applying it under the eyes feel refreshing and soothing. The cream itself is lightweight and absorbs quickly with a gentle pat. Almost instantly, my under-eye area looked brighter and less puffy, an impressive result, especially for someone in their late 40s looking for a little boost in that area. To really test it out, I applied the cream to one eye and left the other bare. The difference was noticeable: smoother, more awake-looking skin on the treated side. BeautyBio recommends applying concealer and the rest of your makeup afterward for a flawless finish, and I found that it layers well with no pilling or creasing. What I appreciate most is how it tackles puffiness and those occasional dark circles we all deal with. It’s become a quick, refreshing step in my routine that makes a visible difference. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. Gifted by BeautyBio",

I wore this for a charity event in Texas (hence the belt and cowboy hat), and then went out after - I was stopped left and right and complimented. Side note: it could pass for a wedding dress. Several people thought my significant other and myself just got married! :sweat_smile:",

I bought this in a small, perfect up top, unbearable down bottom. Exchanged for a medium, and it's the other way around. So I'll have to get it altered. Overall it's a nice dress, the blue is beautiful, nothing amazing for the cost but got quite a few compliments.",

			"This dress is completely see through!!! The tan is a 100% transparent mesh, and it is not lined! This was not a defect, the dress is made to be see through. It’s so see through you can see matching tan underwear, or without you nipples and the shadow under your boobs. You can do a slip on the top part, because the corset back. \nThis is a WARNINg to anyone looking for this as a bridal event dress!! I thought it would be perfect for our rehearsal dinner, but I couldn’t imagine showing up in front of all our family and friends basically naked.",

			"The dress is straight up see through!! The tan lining is just a transparent mesh. It’s complete see through. It’s meant to be see through, not a defect but it’s very misleading online. You can see your underwear straight through, even matching nude. You would definitely need a slip, but would have to find the right one, because it’s so see through you would see any lines and the full shape of the slip! I thought it would be cute for my rehearsal dinner dress, but sadly not so all. If only it were lined.",

			"I was really disappointed with this skirt. The fabric feels really cheap for the price point and it's super see-through (but not in a cute way it just makes it look cheap). It does have a nice stretch to it and the design is pretty so it looks okay from the front. My biggest issue with it and the reason I'm returning it is because the color is completely different from the product picture. It clearly looks like a cool-toned bubblegum pink but in person is more of a warm-toned, peachy color. I'll attach a photo with some pink things I own to show the difference. I was super disappointed because the top I intended to wear it with is bubblegum pink with lavender accents, so I wanted to keep the skirt but it just looked so bad with the outfit I had planned. The difference in pink undertones may be subtle but SO obvious when you put two separate garments together-I wish the product photo was more true to the actual color.",

			"This dress is really light weight, thin, makes for a good pool cover up or resort type of wear! Bright and fun. Love the sleeves and skirt.\n\nI might return it though, because it's not ideal for my body type. My typical size is a 8 to 10 in dresses and though the 8 fits fine everywhere, the cutouts themselves are just really huge for my short torso, and I'm 5'4. The cutouts seem lower on my hips than on the model. You will definitely see any type of underwear/bikini on me poking out of the cutouts. The dress itself looks longer on me compared to the model. I could size down to a 6 probably but then I worry it would be less flattering, a tighter fit all around, and also I'd be worried about showing under boob when I lift my arms (cause again, the cutouts are massive!) I'd have to wear pasties as is cause you can see a bra when I lift my arms. I want to love it, but It's a little too expensive for me to justify just keeping as a pool cover up. If the cutouts were smaller I'd feel better about wearing it as a regular dress, too.",

Also had the same experience as another reviewer of the top lining falling down and exposing my chest. All I had done was bend down to try my shoes on with it and I stood up to see everything exposed. I really do love it on me but could likely find something similar elsewhere for cheaper.

			"I’m about 5’2”, 160 pounds. I wore the dress to a wedding and I think that it’s gorgeous. I wore pasties underneath which you really couldn’t see through the fabric so that was great, but I will say the fabric itself is difficult to work with considering you can’t really keep it wrinkle free. I spent so much time trying to iron and steam it but it’s still wrinkled at the bottom. It was also kind of impossible to get it on, without getting deodorant on it. The fabric also seems to stain really easily. So when I sprayed my perfume, it looked like some of it landed on the dress. I think the overall fit and design of the dress are great. I got a ton of compliments. The fabric is just really hard to keep wrinkle free.",

			"I ordered this gown is a small and medium due to the suggestion saying it ran a little large. The small fit fine but I ultimately went with the medium bc I felt more comfortable in it. But could have easily gotten away with the small. The gown is lined and it is not scratchy or itchy! Perfect for a wedding, gala, ball, prom, etc. Perfect length! I did have the neckline taken in about an inch or two for the perfect tailor look.",

I wasn’t sure if I was going to like the tight/body on fit of the dress but it was so flattering and I got so many compliments! It was also very comfortable. The material is durable and it stays in place very well. Maybe my best Revolve purchase!",

So many compliments and it’s so fun to wear. Honestly the nude long sleeve bodysuit underneath actually snatches me in more and helps the figure anyways since this bodysuit is thin. Definitely recommend if you don’t mind the sheerness or with a nude bodysuit under",

			"So, it was a bit of a gamble. I ended up getting a small. I’m 5’3” and weigh 112 lbs, which is on the smaller side for bust area. The bust area is loose, and the waist area is loose too. I read reviews and thought S was my size, so I should have ordered XS. But, this dress is incredibly flattering and beautiful! The quality is superb, and it’s flowy.",

My measurements are 34 Bust, 28 waist, and 35 hips. I possibly could have gone down to an X-small because it is extremely stretchy.\nP',

			"The dress is a beautiful, buttery soft yellow. But I bought my true size Small and I regret not going one size up. It’s very form fitting which is sexy, but also may make you self conscious. I’m 5’8, 135# and still had a good bit of fabric left on the train. Keep in mind if you’re shorter you’ll have a lot of length at the bottom.",

			"Can't believe it's a sunscreen. This is exactly the amount of glow and moisture you want for a day on the beach. The Gold and the Amber are both really nice. Goes on like a coconut oil moisturizer. Hint of bronze. Smells like cookies. Imagine a sunscreen that makes you look BETTER instead of worse. Absolutely zero white, any skintone can wear these. Sheer enough that it won't stain your bikini. High end airless pump system, as you'd expect at this price point. Would not recommend trying to layer this with makeup on your face, its not that kind of sunscreen, it's very much a gel/oil. Little disappointed to see it expires in 3 months, which is probably why Gold is on sale right now, I can't use this much in that time.",

I’m 5’10”, 34C, and usually wear a M/L; I ordered a medium and love the snug fit. However, if you have broader shoulders or a larger chest, I’d recommend sticking with your usual size. The fabric is a bit thin, which could be an issue in certain lighting, but I’m definitely keeping it for dates and nights out!",

			"Really really great dress! I'm 5'7, about 155lb and ordered Medium. Short, but not overly short, and I have larger thighs and it still looked flattering. Stretchy tight material on stomach, fits like a body con but very flattering, even though that shape doesn't typically flatter my body type. Already loving this brand. Seems really high quality and just really cool designs!",

			"These shoes are amazing. I specifically bought them for my winter in Portugal trip, since the forecast said it would rain, and we planned on visiting several rocky, semi-hiking sites. We also planned all day walking trips through Lisbon. I'm so happy I bought these as they exceeded my expectations. They are very comfortable, my feet did not hurt at all, despite walking for several hours on uneven terrain. I was able to walk up and down the cliffs of Nazaré to see the waves and did not slip once. These shoes are a lifesaver and I might buy the other color. Highly recommended.",

			"Currently I wear small and bought these in a small - they fit a bit bigger in the hip area than I expected. From the photos the pants look flared, but they fit more like a wide leg. The waist doesn’t hug too tight which is nice, but I tend to prefer a tighter fit. The fabric reminds me of a high quality hiking pant and it’s super light so I feel like I can wear these all year round! They are not 100% cotton (some cupro) which I knew going into the purchase. Also the color looks exactly the same as the pictures! Overall I’m happy with the purchase and like how they look either with flats or sneakers :)",

			"The skirt was cute and fit well. However, the black fabric was so cheap! It looked nothing like the photos. It was dull and worn, as if someone ironed it and left the iron on it for too long (you can see the vertical gray lines in the photo). I bought two separate sizes and both skirts were like this. Both were missing tags, so not sure if these were actually previously worn or the quality is just poor. For $172, so disappointing!",

I added a pic of my hand over the bottom part to show how huge it is for a size small; it’s not at all form fitting in the sleeves like the pic on the model, even an extra small would fit much baggier in the shoulders and arms than what’s shown; material is like a cotton - does wrinkle and feels a bit like a cheap sheet; and the last surprise? It has Velcro instead of buttons…",

			"Overall love the Jeans but they run BIG! I recommend downsizing by 1 - 2 sizes from recommended size. They are very stretchy! Love the jeans! And they are long enough on me at 168cm/5‘6. 5ft height. I ordered a size w26 but it was recommended according to the size prediction to order a w28. I am sooo glad I ended up going with an w26, because to be honest I could have gone for a w25 or even w24 because these pants are SUPER stretchy and a bit loose on my low waist (which for reference measures at 84cm/33in. and my hips at about 95cm/37. 5in). I ended up having them altered and take out 5cm/2in around the waist. I highly recommend sizing down 1 or even 2 sizes. Other than that I love the jeans.",

It is great quality and still holds the shine and beauty after all I’ve put them through. I also love the set that I picked because it comes with one silver and two gold. So I can wear all of them on the same wrist or I could put two on one arm and one on the other and style it however I like. Highly recommend recommended!",

I have a flatter chest and when I first out on this dress and lifted up my arm, the center of the silver part broke and there was no fixing it. Then I move again and the strap on the back broke. This dress is terrible quality. The concept is great and I love how the dress looks, but unfortunately this dress is not made to be worn at all. Because of this cheaply made dress breaking the night of my event, I couldn't even attend. Very disappointed.",

			"So I gave this dress 5 stars because I think it’s unfair to give it led due to my body type. The quality is great. The fit is also great but how it looks on someone with very broad shoulders like myself? Not so great, I powerlift so I have a big back where wide shoulders with a tiny waist and massive legs. This dress made me look like a linebacker and not in a good way. If you are broad shouldered I would stay away.",

			"This Save Face Serum by Miami Beach Bum on Revolve Beauty has a very thin consistency and provides great protection with SPF. I love that it absorbs well into my skin, leaving it smooth and soft. It's also super convenient to use and easy to carry with me wherever I go.The only thing is the scent it leaves behind which isn’t to my liking it has a lingering fragrance that’s not quite to my taste. If it were scent-free or had a lighter, more neutral aroma, it would be perfect. Overall, it’s still a great addition to my skincare collection, especially for those looking for an effective serum with SPF protection.giftedby miami beach bum",

			"I wore this dress to my wedding and could not be happier! After alterations it became with exact dress I was on the hunt for! I had the front hemmed and also cinched the front straps to reduce the front cowl neckline. I also removed the tie back because it didn’t need it for stability. For the price the quality was amazing, not see through, and the lining was good. The ivory colour and material is beautiful. The satin is not shiny like normal stain, but it still gave a nice sheen. The body of the dress fit me like a glove and I purchased a M (my waist is 30 and hips are 40 inch). It even has a decent train on it and not too long. I didn’t use the bustier that was included, I ended up using a stick on bra. I have absolutely no regrets about this dress, I cannot believe how little I had to spend for a wedding dress that looked this beautiful. I received so many compliments!",

			"Honestly, game changer!! I skip a lot of outdoor events because I absolutely cannot handle bugs, especially mosquitoes. I use bug spray sometimes but I really can’t stand the smell so I skip it a lot of the time. This bug spray smells really good!! No bug spray scent to it at all, it smells like lemon candy almost. Really nice, even my 9 year old son said it smelled good when I sprayed him before playing outside. (There’s so many mosquitos and little minute Beatles that bite so bug spray is important even in the fall) I will definitely be buying more when I run out!

			"I recently jumped on the trend and added a few big bangles to my jewelry collection, and let me tell you—they have made a fabulous comeback! These bold accessories are not only eye-catching but also incredibly versatile.\n\nThe moment I slipped on my first big bangle, I felt an instant boost of confidence. The size and weight make a statement without being overwhelming. They pair beautifully with everything, from casual jeans and a tee to more dressed-up outfits. I've found that layering them adds a fun, bohemian vibe to my look, while wearing just one can keep things chic and elegant.\n\nThe craftsmanship of these bangles has been impressive too. I opted for a mix of metal and colorful designs, and each piece has held up well against daily wear. They’re sturdy yet comfortable, which is crucial for me since I wear my jewelry all day.\n\nWhat I love most is how big bangles can transform an outfit in an instant. They’re the perfect way to express my personal style and creativity. If you haven't tried incorporating big bangles into your accessory rotation, now is the time! They truly add that extra flair and are sure to turn heads. Highly recommend!",

			"I reallyy wanted to (& still want to) love this dress! It’s a rather awkward cut and shape. The front has a scoop down allowing for the perfect amount of length. The back is cut about 3 inches higher than the front - making it look like a child’s onesie from the back. I know that’s been the style lately, but this is not a good fit for anyone with a curvy bottom - it just causes the dress to rise even more. I wish it had the same or similar cut in the front and back. That would make it perfect. I may have to return this due to the bottom of my cheeks almost being exposed. I normally wear an XS and sized up to a S based on other reviews. I still had this issue. The safest bet is to size up 2x if you want bottom coverage. I’m 5’5 and weigh 125",
